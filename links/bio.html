                    <p class="biobody">Gabe started his musical journey at the age of 8, taking classical piano lessons. A multi- instrumentalist, over the years he has tried his hand at most anything he can get his hands on!  He graduated from University of Nebraska-Omaha with a BA in Jazz Performance where he studied piano Kristin Jonina Taylor (Classical) and Christopher Leach (Jazz). In addition, he studied double bass with Jeremy Baguyos (Classical) and Andy Hall (Jazz).

                    While at University of Nebraska-Omaha, he had the opportunity to perform with and participate in masterclasses with several notable jazz artists including Chris Potter, Stefon Harris and Benny Golson. He also performed with the Universityâ€™s top combo and had the chance to tour Europe and Asia with performances at the Shangai Conservatory Jazz Festival in China and Saulkrasti Jazz Festival in Latvia.
                    
                    Gabe is currently pursuing his MM in Jazz Studies at Northern Illinois University where he is studying jazz piano with Director of Jazz Studies, Reggie Thomas.
